  supermarket is selected at read time.

## 4. Normalization Review

### 1NF
- All entities use atomic attributes.
- No repeating groups in any row.
- Multi-valued concepts (memberships, receipt lines, events) are separated into dedicated tables.

### 2NF
- Surrogate primary keys avoid partial dependency issues.
- In associative entities (HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER), non-key attributes depend on the full business key (household and user membership), enforced by unique constraint.

### 3NF
- Non-key attributes depend only on the key of their table.
- Derived/transient concerns are separated:
  - Receipt metadata in RECEIPT, line-level data in RECEIPT_ITEM.
  - Expiry confidence metadata in EXPIRATION_ASSESSMENT instead of PANTRY_ITEM.
  - Event history in CONSUMPTION_EVENT rather than denormalized counters in PANTRY_ITEM.

### Trade-offs
- PANTRY_ITEM.status can be derived from dates and events, but persisted for fast mobile reads and dashboards.

## 5. Index Strategy (PostgreSQL SQL Recommendations)

```sql
-- USER
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ux_user_email_lower ON "user" (LOWER(email));

-- FK indexes (PostgreSQL does not auto-create indexes for FKs)
CREATE INDEX ix_household_created_by_user_id ON household (created_by_user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_household_member_household_id ON household_member (household_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_household_member_user_id ON household_member (user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_household_invitation_household_id ON household_invitation (household_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_household_invitation_invited_by_user_id ON household_invitation (invited_by_user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_pantry_item_household_id ON pantry_item (household_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_pantry_item_created_by_user_id ON pantry_item (created_by_user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_receipt_household_id ON receipt (household_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_receipt_uploaded_by_user_id ON receipt (uploaded_by_user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_receipt_item_receipt_id ON receipt_item (receipt_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_receipt_item_pantry_item_id ON receipt_item (pantry_item_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_expiration_assessment_pantry_item_id ON expiration_assessment (pantry_item_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_expiration_assessment_confirmed_by_user_id ON expiration_assessment (confirmed_by_user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_consumption_event_pantry_item_id ON consumption_event (pantry_item_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_consumption_event_actor_user_id ON consumption_event (actor_user_id);
CREATE INDEX ix_notification_preference_user_id ON notification_preference (user_id);

-- Access-path indexes for common MVP queries
CREATE INDEX ix_pantry_item_household_status_expiration
  ON pantry_item (household_id, status, expiration_date);

CREATE INDEX ix_consumption_event_item_event_at
  ON consumption_event (pantry_item_id, event_at DESC);

CREATE INDEX ix_receipt_household_created_at
  ON receipt (household_id, created_at DESC);

-- Partial index for expiring workflow
CREATE INDEX ix_pantry_item_expiring_active
  ON pantry_item (household_id, expiration_date)
  WHERE status IN ('FRESH', 'EXPIRING_SOON');

-- Invitation lookup by email/status
CREATE INDEX ix_household_invitation_email_status
  ON household_invitation (LOWER(invitee_email), status);
```

### Index rationale
- FK indexes prevent delete/update lock amplification and speed joins.
- Composite indexes reflect primary mobile read paths: pantry list, expiry view, dashboard summaries.
- Partial index reduces index size and improves expiring-item scans.
- Case-insensitive email index supports auth and invitation lookup safely.

## 6. Prisma Considerations

### Natural mapping to Prisma
- One-to-many relationships:
  - User -> PantryItem
  - Household -> PantryItem
  - Receipt -> ReceiptItem
  - PantryItem -> ConsumptionEvent
- Many-to-many relationships (explicit junction):
  - User <-> Household via HouseholdMember

### Enum recommendations in Prisma
- HouseholdMemberRole: OWNER, MEMBER
- MembershipStatus: ACTIVE, LEFT, REMOVED
- InvitationStatus: PENDING, ACCEPTED, REVOKED, EXPIRED
- PantryItemStatus: FRESH, EXPIRING_SOON, EXPIRED, CONSUMED, WASTED
- ExpirationMethod: RULE_BASED_SPAIN, MANUAL_OVERRIDE
- ConsumptionEventType: CONSUMED, WASTED, SUGGESTED_WASTE, CONFIRMED_WASTE
- OcrStatus: PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED

For business states expected to grow often, use lookup tables instead of hard enums.

### Cascade considerations
- Household -> PantryItem: ON DELETE CASCADE (household removal removes contained items).
- PantryItem -> ConsumptionEvent: ON DELETE CASCADE (or soft-delete strategy if audit retention is mandatory).
- Receipt -> ReceiptItem: ON DELETE CASCADE.
- User deletes should be handled carefully:
  - Prefer soft-delete (deleted_at) in MVP to preserve audit/event consistency.
  - Use RESTRICT or SET NULL on selected relationships where legal/audit retention is required.

### Prisma implementation notes
- Use model-level @@index for all FK fields.
- Use @@unique([householdId, userId]) for HouseholdMember.
- Use @db.Timestamptz for timestamps and Decimal for money/quantities requiring precision.
- Keep optional mapping from ReceiptItem to PantryItem nullable until user confirmation.

## 7. Future Evolution (Minimizing Breaking Changes)

### Households (deeper collaboration)
- Add role granularity (VIEWER, EDITOR) and policy tables without changing core item schema.
- Add HouseholdPolicy table to centralize authorization rules.

### Barcode integration
- Add PRODUCT and PRODUCT_BARCODE tables.
- Keep PANTRY_ITEM.normalized_name for backward compatibility while introducing product_id nullable FK.

### Recipe recommendations
- Add RECIPE, RECIPE_INGREDIENT, and PANTRY_ITEM_MATCH tables.
- No breaking changes to pantry entities required if recommendation is additive.

### Advanced analytics
- Add materialized views or warehouse-facing event exports from CONSUMPTION_EVENT and RECEIPT_ITEM.
- Keep event-first model to avoid destructive schema changes.

### ML-based expiration prediction
- Add EXPIRATION_PREDICTION table with model_version, feature_snapshot_hash, predicted_date, confidence.
- Keep EXPIRATION_ASSESSMENT as user-facing approved state while prediction table stores model outputs.
- This preserves existing API contracts and avoids breaking current expiry flows.

## Suggested Prisma Model Seed Alignment for MVP
- Maintain current USER and PANTRY_ITEM foundations.
- Add HOUSEHOLD and HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER early, since sharing is in MVP scope.
- Add RECEIPT and RECEIPT_ITEM in the same migration batch as OCR processing.
- Add EXPIRATION_ASSESSMENT and CONSUMPTION_EVENT before dashboard analytics.

## 8. Implementation Requirements Alignment (PRD Data Model)

This section maps the database design to PRD data-model requirements that developers should verify before implementation.

### Functional alignment checklist
- Household membership is relational (USER + HOUSEHOLD + HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER).
- Invitation lifecycle is explicit (HOUSEHOLD_INVITATION with status and timestamps).
- Receipt header and receipt lines are split (RECEIPT and RECEIPT_ITEM).
- Consumption/waste is event-based (CONSUMPTION_EVENT).
- Expiry estimation metadata is separated from item core data (EXPIRATION_ASSESSMENT).
- OCR lines can exist before pantry mapping confirmation (nullable pantry_item_id in RECEIPT_ITEM).
- User identity supports case-insensitive uniqueness on email.
- Gamification points/badges, notification delivery/push, and expiry-learning preferences are tracked in dedicated per-user tables (USER_POINTS, USER_BADGE, NOTIFICATION_LOG, PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION, USER_CATEGORY_EXPIRY_PREFERENCE).

### Non-functional alignment checklist
- Precision: money/quantity use NUMERIC/DECIMAL semantics.
- Auditability: timestamped events and timezone-aware fields.
- Integrity: explicit FKs + constraints + constrained statuses.
- Performance: FK indexes + query-path composite indexes + partial expiring index.
- Evolvability: additive schema evolution strategy documented for barcodes, recipes, analytics, and ML prediction.

### Developer pre-implementation notes
- Keep Prisma schema, SQL migrations, and documented constraints synchronized in each iteration.
- Apply migration ordering by dependency graph, not by feature preference.
- Validate that soft-delete policy for USER does not break household, receipt, and event analytics.
- Validate retention and deletion policy for receipt metadata and object storage references before production deployment.
